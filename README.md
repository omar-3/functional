<h1 align="center">Itertools for Chapel</h1>

It's nothing more that you would expect from the name, or is it? This is going to be based on Python itertools but with A LOT of extra steps. I'm targeting to have all the functionalities from multiple projects doing the same thing. I'm going to compare my performance with [cppitertools](https://github.com/ryanhaining/cppitertools), it is super fast compared to Python, but it is missing some functionalities so in that case we are going to do Python.
